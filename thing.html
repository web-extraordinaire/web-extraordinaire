<body><p>In the beginning they flashback to aunt arabela needing money
Then they get their money stolen
After that they are in the barrels being stowaways
Even after that the captain sends them down to dump coal to pay off their ticket
They find the thief
They go through the strait of magellan
The chef tries to get the pig 
The thief gets away (with the pig)
They win the race with the sea raven 
They get to land the miner gets the haircut and they find gold in his hair </p>
