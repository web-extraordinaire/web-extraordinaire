    <p id = "question"> 
    do you know what the longest river is?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> the nile river </li>
      <li> the Amazon river </li>
    </ol>

      <p id = "answer"> whichever one you chose you are <strong>wrong </strong> well kind of... <br>
        if you search it up you will find a lot of answers because no one knows where to start or to end <br>
    because a lot of rivers go out of the big river and some of those rivers are longer than others 
       <br> so you can say either one is smaller or bigger
