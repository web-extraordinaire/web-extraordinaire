    <title>Mercator projection</title>
    </head>
  <body>
    <p>the mercator projection is a flat map projection attempting to show the same earth as a globe</p>
    <p>but it is wrong in one way if you are closer to the equator than your country looks smaller than a country higher or lower on the map </p>
  <p>anyway I already told you all of that so look at this JS (javaScript)</p>
